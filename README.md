This is a 2D world simulation, accomodated with herbivores and predators. The world also contains static objects like grass and rocks.
Predators hunt herbivores. Herbivores find grass and eat it.
The world is a matrix NxM size. Each object accomodates only one cell. it is not allowed to have more than one object in the same cell
